Exploratory data analysis of the English premier league season 2021/2022

<p>Statistics have become an integral part of our daily lives and quality statistical analysis of data is necessary in every field. One area where statistics has been applied for a long time is sports. Over time, sports statistical analysis has greatly advanced and today we have vast amounts of data for various sports that need to be analyzed properly.</p> 
 <p>Quality analysis of these data has become an extremely important factor in the development of sports and individuals, and no one can afford not to do an analysis of the collected data. Most clubs now have a performance analysis team, especially in the English Premier League. The file that will be used in this project contains various statistics for all Premier League players for the 2021-2022 season. Each row of the file refers to a player, and in the columns we can find various statistics related to the players, such as player age, number of goals, number of minutes played, number of yellow cards received, and so on.</p>
When working on this project, please follow these research questions:<b>
• Is there a difference in the number of minutes played by young players (under 25 years old) among Premier League teams? <br>
• Do forwards or midfielders receive more yellow cards on average? <br>
• Can you determine a player's success based on the given parameters? <br>
• Do "homegrown" players (i.e. English national players) or foreign players contribute more to the overall success of their team? <br>
